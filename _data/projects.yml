- name: Activity Recognition
  description: In 2015 we developed an Apple Watch application for activity and exercise recognition for eGym during the MPD course at CDTM. For the recognition I ported the Gesture Recognition Toolkit to the Apple Watch OS and we trained a Dynamic Time Warping model to classify movements (accelerometer values).
  skills:
    - Swift
    - DWT
